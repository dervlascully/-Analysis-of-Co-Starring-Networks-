# -Analysis-of-Co-Starring-Networks-
Constructed networks for two movie-related datasets, characterised the structure, connectivity, and centrality.

Project for the module COMP30850 Network Analysis.

In this assignment I constructed and characterise network representations of two movie-related datasets. My networks model the co-starring relations between the actors within these two datasets. 

I constructed each network and compared the structure, connectivity and centrality. I then identified one important node in each network and constructed an ego network for that node, before exploring the structure, connectivity and centrality of the ego networks.
